# Capstone Project App: Word Prediction  

The aim of the [Data Science Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-project) project was to create a simple (but functional) Shiny App that would predict the next word from a given phrase.  

The task was definitely interesting and stimulating to me, since it involved delving into a new subject, NLP, understanding its peculiarities and creating an efficient modeling application. I also had to take care of sampling the training data, in order to allow the application to run smoothly and without great delay, while still offering coherent results.  

The app I created is available on [shinyapps.io](https://robertopreste.shinyapps.io/WordPredictionApp).  
Documentation can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/robertopreste/datasciencecoursera/tree/master/Capstone_Project).  
The pitch presentation for the app is on [rpubs.com](https://rpubs.com/robertopreste/wordpredictionpitch).
