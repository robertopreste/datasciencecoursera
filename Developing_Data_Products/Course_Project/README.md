# DNase Regression App  

## Documentation  

The DNase dataset is part of the `datasets` R package, and was obtained during development of an ELISA assay for the recombinant protein DNase in rat serum. More information can be found [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/DNase.html).  

The aim of the experiment was to determine the concentration of the DNase protein starting from the detected optical density of the sample.  

The DNase Regression App can be found on [shinyapps.io](https://robertopreste.shinyapps.io/DNaseRegressionApp/).  
The presentation showing its usage can be found on [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/robertopreste/dnaseregressionpitch).
